<b>IN  THE  HIGH  COURT  OF  DELHI  AT  NEW  DELHI</b> <br/>

<b>CORAM:</b> <br/><b>HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER </b><br/>
<b>RAJIV SHAKDHER, J.: (ORAL) <br/>I.A. 16517/2018 </b><br/>
1.This  is  an  application  for  seeking  condonation  of  delay  in  filing 
the reply. <br/>
1.1  The period of delay is 13 days. <br/>
1.2  For the reasons given in the application, the delay is condoned. <br/>
2.The Registry will place the reply on record. <br/>
3.The application is, accordingly, disposed of. <br/>
<b>ARB.P. 545/2018 </b><br/>

4.Notice in this petition was issued on 31.7.2018 which was  made 
returnable on 10.10.2018. <br/>
4.1  On  10.10.2018,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  was  granted
ten (10) days to file a reply. <br/>
4.2  As  noted  hereinabove,  the  reply  is  under  objection  and  not  on
record. <br/>
4.3  The  reason,  perhaps,  was  that  the  reply  was  filed  beyond  the 
period  allocated  by  this  Court  vide  order  dated  10.10.2018.  However, 
counsel for the respondent, on being queried, says that the respondent’s 
principal  objection  to  the  arbitration  petition is that  the claim  which is
sought to be placed before the Arbitral Tribunal is barred by limitation. <br/>
4.4  Learned counsel for the respondent, however, says that there is no 
dispute as regards the existence of an arbitration agreement. <br/>
5 I may only note that counsel for the petitioner says that the claim 
is within the period of limitation. <br/>
5.1  This  argument  is  articulated  on  the  basis  that  the  agreement 
between the parties was executed on 14.6.2013, whereupon, supplies of 
paddy and lentils were made. <br/>
5.2  The claim of the petitioner emanates from the alleged withholding 
of amounts against the supplies made. <br/>
5.3  It is the petitioner’s case that the respondent has wrongly withheld 
a sum of Rs.59,60,127.50. <br/>
6.The  petitioner  further  avers  that  several  request  letters  were 
served  on  the  respondent.  This  being  letters  dated  16.4.2015,  2.9.2015 
and 30.5.2016. <br/>
>
7.The  petitioner  also  claims  that  since  a  notice  dated  10.6.2016 
triggering the arbitration agreement was served on the respondent and, 
therefore the claim is within limitation. <br/>
8.Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent,  on  the  other  hand,  raises 
objections  on  the  ground  that  since  the  instant  petition  was  filed  on 
2.6.2018, the claim is barred by limitation. <br/>
8.1  According to me, <i>prima facie</i>, this submission is unsustainable. <br/>
9.However, given the fact that there is no dispute as to the existence 
of an arbitration agreement, I am inclined to allow the prayer. <br/>
10.  Accordingly, Ms. Ravinder Kaur, (Cell no.:9910384660), former 
District &amp; Sessions Judge, is appointed as the Arbitrator. <br/>
11.  Since both the counsel are agreed that the arbitration proceedings 
should  be  held  under  the  aegis  of  the  Delhi  International  Arbitration 
Centre (in short ‘Centre’), it is ordered accordingly. <br/>
11.1  Consequently, the rules and the fee schedule of the Centre would 
apply in this case. <br/>
12.  The petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms. <br/>
13.  The  Registry  is  directed  to  despatch  a  copy  of  this  order  to  the 
Co-ordinator, DIAC and the learned Arbitrator. <br/>
