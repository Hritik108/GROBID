<b>JUDGMENT (ORAL) </b><br/>
1.The petition at hand invokes  Article 227 of the Constitution of
India to bring a challenge to the order dated 03.08.2017 passed by 
the  Senior  Civil  Judge  (South)  at  Saket  Courts,  New  Delhi  in  the 
course  of  proceedings  arising  out  of  the  civil  suit,  presently 
registered as CS no. SCJ 82862/16, which was originally instituted 
by  the  petitioner  on  06.11.1989,  whereby  the  application  under
Order  I  Rule  10  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code,  1908  (CPC)  of  the 
tenth  respondent,  Central  Reserve  Police  Force  (CRPF)  was 
allowed and it was impleaded as tenth defendant.</b> <br/>

2. It may be noted at the outset that the civil suit, which has been 
pending  since  1989,  concerns  a  plot  of  land  described  by  the 
petitioner  (plaintiff)  as  Lal  Masjid  Qabristan  in  Khasra  no.  389, 
360  and  361  within  revenue  record  of  the  village,  Aliganj,  Lala 
Lajpatrai Marg, New Delhi, the prayer in the civil suit being for a 
decree for permanent injunction against interference in the peaceful 
possession and enjoyment thereof or from committing trespass into 
it or  against  putting any  <i>malba</i>  into it  or causing  any  damage  and 
demolition  to  the  graveyard  and  the  property  or  leveling  any 
portion by the parties in the case arrayed as defendants.</b><br/>
3.The  array  of  defendants  in  the  suit,  as  originally  presented  by 
the petitioner, included Union Of India through its Secretary in the  
Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (first  defendant);  Delhi  Administration 
through  its  Chief  Secretary  now  Government  of  NCT  of  Delhi 
(second  defendant);  Central  Public  Works  Department  (CPWD) 
through  its  Chief  Engineer  (third  defendant);  Land  and 
Development  Officer  (fourth  defendant);  Delhi  Development 
Authority (fifth defendant); Municipal Corporation of Delhi (sixth 
defendant);  the  Commissioner  of  Police  New  Delhi  (seventh 
defendant);  Station  House  Officer  of  Police  Station  Lodhi  Colony 
(eighth  defendant);  and  New  Delhi  Municipal  Committee  (ninth 
defendant).    It  may  also  be  noted  here  that  the  defendants, 
particularly the Union of India in the course of contest, have taken 
the  position  that  suit  property  is  government  land  and  that  the 
plaintiff is an unauthorized and illegal<b> </b>occupier of the same.  <b> </b><br/>

4.It  is  stated  that  the  Land  and  Development  Officer  of 
Government  of  India  (fourth  defendant  in  the  suit)  had  originally
earmarked the land in question to CPWD (third defendant) but, by 
letter  dated  28.02.2017,  it  has  allotted  land  admeasuring    2.23 
acres,  to  CRPF  for  construction  of  its  office  accommodation, 
shifting of  Canteen, barracks for men and parking of vehicles etc. </b><br/>
5.It  is  against  the  aforesaid  backdrop  that  the  application  under 
Order  I  Rule  10  of  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908(CPC)  was 
moved before the  Senior Civil Judge on 29.04.2017 by the  Senior 
Central Government Counsel seeking impleadment of CRPF (to be 
represented through its Director General) as one of the defendants. 
The application was contested by the petitioner/plaintiff, as noticed 
in the order, by pleadings to the effect that such impleadment was 
not necessary <i>inter alia</i> because it was in breach of the doctrine of 
<i>lis-pendens</i> under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 
and that such move is belated and would delay the trial.  The Trial 
Judge  has  found  such  objections  to  be  devoid  of  substance  and 
found it appropriate to implead CRPF as an additional defendant.<b> </b><br/>
6.The petition is pressed to challenge the above mentioned order 
on the same very contentions as were urged before the learned trial 
judge.  Reliance is placed on decisions of learned single judges of 
this court in <i>Sanjay Gupta Vs. Smt. Kala Wati 85 (2000) DLT 828,</i> 
<i>Prakash  Khattar  Vs.  Shanta  Jindal  &amp;  Ors.  181  (2011)  DLT  138</i> 
and  <i>Bhim  Singh  Vs.  Amar  Nath  &amp;  Ors.  149  (2008)  DLT  34</i>  to 
submit  that  the  allotment  in  favour  of  the  CRPF  was  in  breach  of 
the  doctrine  of  <i>lis-pendens</i>  as  per  Section  52  of  the  Transfer  of 
Property  Act,  1882.    It  is  also  argued  that  the  impleadment  of  a 
party  against  the  stand  taken  by  the  plaintiff  is  permitted  only  if
there is a legal right vesting in such additional party making him a 
necessary  party  within  the  meaning  of  the  provision  contained  in 
Order I Rule 10 CPC.<b> </b><br/>

7.Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned 
counsel  representing  the  respondents,  this  Court  finds  no  merit  in 
the  petition.    The  view  taken  by  the  learned  trial  judge  in  the 
impugned order does not call for any interference.  The validity of 
allotment  in  favour  of  CRPF  cannot  be  questioned  or  determined 
without  the  party  in  question  (the  allottee)  being  arrayed  as 
defendant.    By  such  allotment,  CRPF  claims  to  have  acquired  a 
vested  interest.  In  these  circumstances,  it  is  not  merely  a  proper 
party, but a necessary party to the proceedings. <b> </b><br/>
8.The petition is, therefore, dismissed.<b> </b><br/>
