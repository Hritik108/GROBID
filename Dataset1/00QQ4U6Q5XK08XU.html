1.The  present  petition  has  been  filed  by  the  petitioner  praying  <i>inter </i>
<i>alia</i>  for  issuing  a  writ  of  mandamus  directing  the  respondent 
No.1/Registrar  Cooperative  Societies  (RCS)  to  consider  and  dispose  of 
his  representation  filed  under  Section  77  of  Delhi  Cooperative  Societies 
Act  (DCS  Act)  and  for  directing  the  respondent  No.2  to  allot  him  a 
Category ‘A’ flat in Saraswati Cooperative Group Housing Society Ltd. <br/>
2.Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the petitioner became 
a  member  of  the  respondent  No.2/Society  on  30.01.1991.  The  petition 
refers to the fact that the petitioner had deposited a sum of Rs.9,00,000/- 
with the Respondent No.2/Society between year 1991 and 2000. Though 
there  is  not  a  whisper  in  the  petition  as  to  the  background  in  which  his
membership  was  initially  cancelled, he  has  averred  that  his  membership
was restored in the Arbitration proceedings. </br>
3.It is the version of the Respondent No.2/Society that the petitioner 
had tendered his resignation from the Society in the year 1998, which is 
disputed by the counsel for the petitioner.  However, he is not in position 
to  explain  the  circumstances  in  which  the  membership  of  the  petitioner 
was  terminated  and  then  restored.    The  next  relevant  date  mentioned  in 
the petition is 28.01.2016, when the petitioner claims to have filed a RTI 
application  before  the  respondent  No.1/RCS  for  obtaining  information 
with regard to the details of the Administrator appointed in respect of the 
respondent No.2/Society.  <br/>
4.It  is  not  disputed  by  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  that  the 
proceedings  filed  by  the  petitioner  before  the  RCS  under  Section  77  of 
DCS Act are pending adjudication. Without awaiting closure of the said 
proceedings,  he  has  approached  this  Court  for  seeking  direction  to  the 
respondent no.1/RCS for disposing of a representation made by him. <br/>
5.On  08.12.2016, learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  No.1/RCS had 
stated that the submissions made by the petitioner in the present petition 
would be considered and appropriate order issued. <br/>
6.Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  No.1  states  that  he  has  also 
filed  a  status  report  on  09.02.2017,  in  compliance  of  the  order  dated 
08.12.2016  wherein  it  has  been  submitted  that  despite  repeated 
opportunities  given  to  the  petitioner  to  produce  the  original  records 
pertaining  to  his  membership  and  the  payments  allegedly  deposited  by 
him  with  the  respondent  No.2/Society,  from  time  to  time,  no  document 
whatsoever has been furnished by him to substantiate the same.  

7.At this, learned counsel for the petitioner hands over a letter dated 
11.04.2017,  addressed  by  the  respondent  No.1/RCS  to  the  respondent 
No.2/Society  calling  upon  it  to  furnish  certain  documents  as  detailed 
therein  so  that  the  petitioner’s  representation  can  be  considered  and 
decided. <br/>
8.Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  No.2/Society  states  that  an 
Administrator  was  appointed  in  respect  of  the  respondent  No.2/Society, 
somewhere  in  the  year  2006  and  he  has  handed  over  the  charge  to  the 
newly  elected  Managing  Committee  of  the  Society  only  on  19.02.2017. 
The  documents  required  to  be  furnished  by  the  Society  are  being  traced 
for being placed before the respondent No.1/RCS.  He states that such of 
the documents that are traceable, shall be forwarded within two weeks. <br/>
9.In  view  of  the  submissions  made  by  learned  counsel  for  the 
respondent  No.2/Society  as  recorded  above,  the  present  petition  is 
disposed  of  with  a  direction  to  the  respondent  no.1/RCS to  examine  the 
documents  furnished  by  the  Society  and  take  a  decision  on  the  pending 
application of the petitioner within 8 weeks from the date of receipt of the 
documents, under written intimation to him. <br/>
10.The petition is disposed of. <br/>
