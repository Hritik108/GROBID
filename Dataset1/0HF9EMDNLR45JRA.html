<b>CORAM:</b> <br/><b>HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL GAUR </b><br/>
<b>ORDER <br/> (ORAL)</b> <br/>
1<b>. </b>Impugned  order  of  16th  October,  2017  <i>(Annexure  P-1)</i>  rejects 
petitioner’s application for allotment of alternate plot in lieu of acquired 
land on the ground that the following requisite documents have not been 
furnished:- <br/>
(i). Affidavit <br/>
(ii). Complete revenue record <br/>
(iii). Ownership status <br/>
(iv). R.D.(Relinquishment Deed) <br/>
2. Counsel for petitioner submits that on the last date of hearing, copy 
of  Minutes  of  Meeting  of  the  Recommendation  Committee  held  on  17th 
September, 2014 was handed over to respondents’ counsel to clarify as to 
how  the  impugned  order  can  be  justified,  as  the  Recommendation 
Committee  had  recommended  the  case  of  petitioner  for  allotment  of 
alternate plot way back in the year 2014.
3. On  behalf  of  respondent,  it  is  maintained  that  the  requisite 
documents,  as  afore-noted,  have  not  been  supplied  and  therefore,  the 
competent authority has rejected the case of petitioner. On the other hand, 
petitioner’s counsel maintains that aforesaid documents were appended to 
the application seeking allotment of alternate plot. <br/>
4. Without going into this aspect any further, it is deemed appropriate 
to  dispose  of  this  petition  with  direction  to  respondent  to  reconsider 
petitioner’s application <i>(Annexure P-3)</i> after the aforesaid documents are 
supplied  by  petitioner  within  three  weeks  from  today.  Upon  receipt  of 
such  documents,    petitioner’s  application  <i>(Annexure  P-3)</i>  be  considered 
by  respondent  within  twelve  weeks  and  its  fate  be  made  known  to 
petitioner within three weeks thereafter, so that petitioner may avail of the 
remedies, as available in law, if need be. <br/>
5. With aforesaid directions, this petition is disposed of.<b> </b><br/>
