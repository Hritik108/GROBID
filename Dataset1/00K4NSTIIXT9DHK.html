<b>CRL.L.P. 258/2018 </b><br/>
1.Petitioner  (APS  Forex  Services  Pvt.  Ltd.)  filed  complaint  case  no.
613773/16 under Section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (in short 'NI 
Act') alleging that in discharge of liability arising out of issuance of foreign 
exchange/USD  card  under  LERM  scheme  vide  request  letters  dated  10th
Januray,  2014,  20th  February,  2014  and  22nd  February,  2014,  respondent 
no. 1 (Shakti International Fashion Linkers) issued four cheques totaling to
Rs.12,55,513/- which were dishonored. When the aforesaid fact was brought 
to the knowledge of the respondent, fresh cheque bearing no. 374941  dated 
31st  May,  2014  for  a  sum  of  Rs.9,55,574/-  drawn  on  Oriental  Bank  of 
Commerce,  Defence  Colony  Branch,  New  Delhi  was  issued.  Aforesaid 
cheque  was  also  returned  unpaid  vide  memo  dated  2nd  June,  2014  with 
remarks  'Stop  Payment'.  Petitioner  issued  a  legal  notice  dated  10th  June, 
2014 through registered post but the respondent failed to make the payment. 
Hence, the present complaint. <br/>

2.To  prove  the  case,  authorized  signatory  of  petitioner  examined 
himself  as  CW-1  and  tendered  his  evidence  by  way  of  an  affidavit  as 
Ex.CW-1/2 and also exhibited request letters dated 10th January, 2014, 20th 
February,  2014  and  22nd  February,  2014  as  Ex.CW-1/D,  Ex.CW-1/E  and 
Ex.CW-1/F  respectively,  letter  dated  22nd  February,  2014  as  Ex.CW-1/G, 
invoice no. 9865 as Ex. CW-1/I, invoice no. 10020 as Ex.CW-1/K, invoice 
no. 10021 as Ex.CW-1/L, original cheque as Ex.CW-1/M, cheque returning 
memo  as  Ex.CW-1/O  and  legal  demand  notice  as  Ex.CW-1/P.  During  his 
cross-examination, the  petitioner  proved  his  statement  of  ledger  account  as 
Ex.CW-1/T  (colly),  bank  statement  as  Ex.  CW-1/U  (colly),  details  of 
debtors  and  creditors  as  Ex.  CW-1/D2,  service  tax  details  as  Ex.CW-1/D3 
(colly), statement of travel card as Ex.CW-1/D6 and list of sundry creditors 
as Ex.CW-1/D7. <br/>
3. Sushil Kumar, partner of respondent no. 1, in his statement recorded 
under Section 313 Cr.P.C. stated that he was the signatory to the cheque and 
the  cheque  was  issued  as  blank  security  cheque  wherein  the  amount  was 
filed  by  the  petitioner.  He  further  submitted  that  the  request  letters  were 
forged and fabricated. He also submitted that the cards, for which payment 
was sought, were not issued by respondent no. 1. <br/>

4.Anuj  Sharma,  respondent  no.  2,  in  his  statement  recorded  under 
Section 313 Cr.P.C. stated that he was also a partner of respondent no. 1 and 
took the same stand as Sushil Kumar.  <br/>
5.Respondents did not lead any defence evidence. <br/>
6.It  is  the  case  of  the  petitioner  that  Sushil  Kumar  approached  the 
Petitioner for issuance of foreign exchange/USD card under LERM Scheme 
vide request letters dated 10th January, 2014, 20th February, 2014 and 22nd 
February,  2014.  Petitioner  had  issued  USD  card  of  15,000/-  amounting  to 
Rs. 9,45,746/- vide invoice no. 9865 dated 10th January, 2014, travel card of 
$10,000  amounting  to  Rs.6,35,554/-  vide  invoice  no.  9993  dated  20th 
February,  2014,  foreign  exchange  of  USD  (CN)  2500  amounting  to 
Rs.1,60,010/- vide invoice no. 10020 dated 22nd February, 2014 and foreign 
exchange  of  USD  (CN)  2500  amounting  to  Rs.1,60,010/-  vide  invoice  no. 
10021  dated  22nd  February,  2014.  Aforesaid  transactions  totaled  to  Rs.
19,01,320/-, out of which part payment was made by the respondent firm of 
Rs. 6,45,307/-. In discharge of the foresaid liability, cheque for a sum of Rs. 
9,55,574/- was issued.  <br/>
7.From the documents placed on record, it is evident that USD card for 
a sum of 15,000/- was issued on 10th January, 2014, however, the travel for 
the card was allegedly issued to commence from 8th January, 2014. The bill 
was not raised in the name of individual traveller and the USD card reached 
the  traveller  who  would  have  already  reached  his  destination  on  the  day 
when  the  bill  was  raised.  How  the  USD  card  reached  the  traveller  who 
would  have  been  already  at  the  destination  was  not  explained.  USD  card 
issued to the traveller on 10th January, 2014 against the ticket of scheduled 
travel  of  8th  January,  2014  was  also  not  explained.  Thus,  the  issuance  of
USD  card  of  15,000/-  against  request  letter  dated  10th  January,  2014  was 
doubtful. <br/>

8.Furthermore,  the  petitioner  failed  to  produce  vouchers  containing 
acknowledgement of receipt of two transactions of foreign exchange of USD 
(CN)  2500  dated  22nd  February,  2014.    With  respect  to  the  transaction 
pertaining to issuance of travel card of $10,000 amounting to Rs.6,35,554/- 
vide  invoice  no.  9993  dated  20th  February,  2014,  the  amount  actually 
withdrawn  therefrom  was  not  proved.  Though  the  petitioner  produced  the 
statement  of  account  of  travel  card  Ex.CW-1/D6,  however,  the  same  was 
neither  proved  in  terms  of  Bankers'  Book  Evidence  Act,1891  nor 
accompanied by certificate under section 65B of Indian Evidence Act, 1872, 
thus inadmissible in evidence. <br/>
9.Considering  the  evidence  on  record,  the  learned  Trial  Court  rightly 
held that the petitioner failed to prove that there was any legal liability of the 
respondents to pay the cheque amount and dismissed the complaint, thereby 
acquitting  the  respondents.  Finding  of  the  learned  Trial  Court  is  neither 
illegal nor perverse warranting interference. <br/>
10.Leave to appeal petition is dismissed. <br/>
