<b>CORAM:</b> <br/><b>HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL GAUR </b>
<a name=2></a> <br/>
<b>O R D E R <br/>  (ORAL)</b>   <br>
1.In the above captioned first petition, quashing of FIR No.150/2012,
whereas  in  the  above  captioned  second  petition,  quashing  of  FIR 
No.131/2012, both registered at police station Sarojini Nagar, New Delhi 
is  sought.  Both  the  FIRs  arise  out  of  one  common  incident.  In  FIR 
No.150/2012,  petitioners  Om  Prakash  and  others  have  been  put  on  trial
for  the  offence  under  Section  325/34  IPC  and  in  FIR  No.  131/2012, 
petitioners Rakesh @ Banti and others have been put on trial for offences 
under Sections 325/506/34 IPC. Quashing of these FIRs is sought on the 
ground  that  the  misunderstanding  which led to this  incident, now  stands 
cleared between the parties. <br/>
2.Mr.M.P.Singh,  Additional  Public  Prosecutor  for  respondent-State, 
accepts notice in FIR No.131/2012 and submits that Om Prakash Lamba, 
who  is  complainant  of  this  FIR,  is  present  in  the  Court.  Ms.  Neelam 
Sharma,  Additional  Public  Prosecutor  for  respondent-State  in  FIR 
No.150/2012  accepts  notice  and  submits  that  Rachit  Kansal  and  Mr. 
Rakesh @ Bunti, who are complaints of this FIR, are present in the Court. 
SI  Shiv  Kumar,  who  is  the  Investigating  Officer  of  these  FIRs,  has 
identified the private respondents present in the Court as complainants of 
these two FIRs.  <br/>
3.With  the  consent  of  learned  counsel  for  the  parties,  both  these 
petitions  have  been  heard  together  and  are  being  disposed  of  by  this 
common order.  <br/>
4.Complainants of these cross FIRs submit that the 
misunderstanding,  which  led  to  registration  of  cross  FIRs,  now  stands
cleared and they stand by the affidavits filed in support of these petitions.
They  submit  both  the  sides  are  neighbours  and  to  restore  harmony 
between the parties, proceedings arising out of these two FIRs be brought 
to an end.  <br/>
5.In  <i>"Gian  Singh  Vs.  State  of  Punjab"  </i>(2012)  10  SCC  303<i>  </i>Apex 
Court has recognized the need of amicable resolution of disputes in cases 
like the instant one, by observing as under:- <br/>
<i>“61. In  other  words,  the  High  Court  must  consider </i>
<i>whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to  continue  with  the  criminal  proceedings    or  continuation  of criminal proceedings  would  tantamount  to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and the  wrongdoer  and  whether  to  secure  the  ends  of  justice,  it  is appropriate  that  criminal  case  is  put  to  an  end  and  if  the answer  to  the  above question(s)  is in  the affirmative, the  High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceedings.” <br/></i>
7.The  aforesaid  dictum  stands  reiterated  by  the  Apex  Court  in  a
recent judgment in<i> Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab </i>(2014) 6 SCC 466<i><b>.</b></i><b> </b><i> </i><br/>
8.In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  incident  in  question,  which  led  to 
lodging  of  these  two  FIRs,  took  place  on  a  trivial  issue  and  the 
misunderstanding  amongst  the  parties  now  stands  cleared,  this  Court 
finds  that  continuance  of  proceedings  arising  out  of  these  cross  FIRs 
would be an exercise in futility.  <br/>
9.Accordingly, the proceedings  arising out of  FIR  No.150/2012 and 
FIR  No.131/2012,  both  registered  at  police  station  Sarojini  Nagar,  New 
Delhi shall stand quashed, subject to deposit of cost of ₹10,000/- each in 
the  above  captioned  two  petitions  with  the  <i>Prime  Minister‟s  National </i>
<i>Relief  Fund</i>  within  four  weeks  and  after  placing  on  record  receipt  of 
deposit of cost within two weeks thereafter.   <br/>
10.The above captioned two petitions and applications are disposed of
in aforesaid terms.  <br/>
