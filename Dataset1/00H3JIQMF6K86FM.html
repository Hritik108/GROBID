1.This Regular Second Appeal filed under Section 100 of the Code of 
Civil  Procedure,  1908  (CPC)  impugns  the  concurrent  Judgments  of  the  courts 
below;  of  the  Trial  Court  dated  13.4.2015  and  the  First  Appellate  Court  dated 
3.5.2016;  by  which  the  courts  below  have  decreed  the  suit  filed  by  the 
respondent/plaintiff  for  permanent  and  mandatory  injunction.  Operative 
paragraph  30  of  the  judgment  of  the  trial  court  decreeing  the  suit  reads  as
under:-  <br/>
“In  the  light  of  discussion  hereinabove,  suit  of  the  plaintiff  is  decreed.    The 
defendant  is  hereby  restrained  from  constructing  any  staircases  at  the  back portion of the property bearing no. 277/7, Ground Floor, Pul Prahaladpur, New Delhi.  The defendant is also hereby restrained from blocking and locking the common passage entrance gate and bathroom at the ground floor of the above said property.  The defendant is further restrained from creating any hindrance in the use of common passage and bath room by the plaintiff in any manner on the ground floor of the above said property.  The defendant is also decreed to
remove the goods kept  by him in the common  passage at the ground floor of the  above  said  property.    In  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  no  order  for  cost.  Parties shall bear their own cost.” <br/>
(underlining added) <br/>
2.The  case  of  the  respondent/plaintiff  was  that  she  purchased  the 
basement/lower  ground  floor  of  the  property  bearing  No.  277/7,  Pul 
Prahaladpur,  New  Delhi,  as  per  documentation  dated  26.10.2005  from  Sh. 
Kuljeet  Singh.      The  title  documents  included    registered  General  Power  of 
Attorney,  agreement  to  sell,  affidavit  etc.    By  these  documents  proved  as 
Ex.PW1/16 (colly) before the trial court, respondent/plaintiff purchased rights in 
the  suit property  along  with common  passage  for  approach, staircase etc.   The 
respondent/plaintiff was enjoying the common passage, staircase and bathroom 
on  the  ground  floor  since  the  date  of  purchase  of  the  suit  property  and  the 
respondent/plaintiff had installed entrance gate and the door at the back portion 
of  the  common  passage  with  the  joint  funds  with  other  shopkeepers  for  safety 
purpose.  Electricity  meter  of  the  respondent/plaintiff  was  also  installed  at  the 
common  passage  of  the  ground  floor  of  the  suit  property.    That  the 
appellant/defendant  has  wilfully  and  illegally  blocked  the  common  passage  by 
keeping  his  almirah  and  table  and  he  also  has  locked  the  bathroom.  
Appellant/defendant was seeking to create hindrance in the use of the common 
passage,  and  also  the  bathroom  and  was  trying  to  illegally  put  locks  at  the 
ground floor of the suit property.  Appellant/defendant was also illegally trying 
to build the staircase  on the back portion of the suit property, therefore, closing 
the door of the back portion as well as the window of the basement property of 
the  respondent/plaintiff.    he  subject  suit  hence  was  filed  by  the 
respondent/plaintiff with the following prayers:- <br/>
“(a)  pass  a  decree  of  permanent  injunction  in  favour  of  the  plaintiff  by restraining  the  defendants,  their  agents,  associates,  legal  heirs  etc.  from constructing the staircase at back portion of the said property and blocking and locking the common passage entrance gate and bathroom at the ground floor of the  suit  property  and  not  to  interfere  in  the  use  of  common  passage  and bathroom by the plaintiff in any manner. <br/>
(b)  Pass a decree of mandatory injunction in favour of the plaintiff and against the  defendant  by  removing  the  goods  kept  by  the  defendant  in  the  common passage at the ground floor.  <br/>
(c)    Cost  of  the  suit  be  awarded  in  favour  of  the  plaintiff  and  against  the defendant.  <br/>
(d)    Any  other  relief  (s)  this  Hon‟ble  Court  may  deems  fit  and  proper  in  the facts and circumstances in the present case.”<i> </i><br/>
3.Appellant/defendant  filed  his  written  statement  and  denied  the 
rights of the respondent/plaintiff in the common passage or the bathroom or in 
the  back  portion.    It  was  pleaded  that  the  respondent/plaintiff  had  no  rights  in 
the common passage or the back portion or the bathroom of the ground floor of 
the property.    <br/>
4.After  pleadings  were  completed, the  trial court  on  12.9.2011  framed  the 
following issues:- <br/>
“(1) Whether the suit is bad for mis-joinder on necessary parties? OPD <br/>
(2) Whether the suit is barred by delay and latches? OPD <br/>
(3) Whether the plaintiff has not approached the Court with clean  
hand? OPD <br/>
(4)  Whether  the  plaintiff  is  entitled  to  a  decree  of  permanent  injunction  as prayed for in prayer clause (a) of the plaint? OPD <br/>
(5)  Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of mandatory injunction as <br/>prayed for in prayer clause (b) of the plaint?  OPD <br/>
(6) Relief. ” <br/>

5.Evidence  was  led  by  the  plaintiff  as  PW1  proving  certain 
documents besides  also summoning witness PW2 Sh. Jagmohan Sharma, from 
the office of the local electricity company/BSES.  Appellant/defendant however, 
failed  to  lead  his  evidence  and  his  evidence  was  closed  by  the  Order  dated 
22.8.2013.  These aspects are noted in paras 6 to 8 of the judgment of the trial 
court and which read as under:- <br/>
“(6) The plaintiff examined herself as PW1 to prove her case.  She reiterated the facts stated in the plaint.  She relied upon the following documents.  <br/>
(a) Ex.PW-1/1 to Ex. PW 1/8 are photographs indicating the „Kainchi gate‟ at point A; <br/>
(b) Ex.PW 1/9 is receipt of Jeevan Citizen Service Center run by the plaintiff at her premises;  <br/>
(c) Ex.PW 1/10 is the copy of electricity bill in the name of Sh. Kuljeet Singh, of  period  from  10.11.2005  to  13.01.2016  indicated  at  point  X  pertaining  to property of plaintiff in the suit premises;  <br/>
(d)  Ex.  PW  1/11  is  the  copy  of  electricity  bill  in  the  name  of  the  plaintiff pertaining to the period March, 2008; <br/>
(e) Ex. PW 1/12 is the electricity bill in the name of Kuljeet Singh of CRN No. 2510114324 (previous owner of property i.e. basement) of plaintiff;  <br/>
(f) Ex. PW 1/13 (colly) is name changed demand notice to  the plaintiff dated 30.10.2010 in respect of electricity meter bearing K No. 2511 N 8031735 from Sh. Kuljeet Singh in her name; <br/>
(g) Ex. PW 1/14 is a site plan of the suit property i.e. the ground floor highlight the common area from point A, B, C and D;  <br/>
(h) Ex PW 1/15 (colly) are two complaints made to the police by the plaintiff dated 21.05.2011 and 24.05.2011;  <br/>
(i)  Ex.  PW  1/16  (colly-24  pages)  are  the  copies  of  registered  GPA  with consideration  from  previous  owner  i.e.  Sh.  Kuljeet  Singh  to  the  plaintiff  and previous chain of property papers of basement property of the plaintiff.  <br/>
(7)  The  plaintiff  has  also  examined  Mr.  Jagmohan  Sharma,  Section  Officer, BSES  Office,  Pul  Prahaladpur,  New  Delhi,  as  PW2.    He  has  produced summoned record.  The entire file including requisite documents for change of name  along  with  check  list  and  acknowledgement  of  DSS  request  order  for change  of  name  from  Kuljeet  Singh  to  Shobha  Shukla  duly  certified  are 
exhibited as Ex. PW2/A (colly-16 pages).  <br/>
(8) PE was closed vide order dated 31.07.2013. The defendant did not lead any evidence.  DE was closed vide order dated 22.08.2013.” <br/>
6.        The courts below have held that respondent/plaintiff by  means of  her 
title  documents  Ex.PW1/16  (colly)  has  proved  that  respondent/plaintiff 
purchased  besides  the  basement/lower  ground  floor,  right  in  the  common 
passage,  staircase  etc,  and  therefore,  respondent/plaintiff  had  rights  to  use  the 
common  passage,  bathroom  on  the  ground  floor  as  also  prevent  the 
appellant/defendant from closing the back door and construct the staircase at the 
back.   <br/>
7.In my opinion, no substantial question of law arises under Section 
100  CPC  for  setting  aside  of  the  concurrent  judgments  of  courts  below 
inasmuch  as  whereas  the  respondent/plaintiff  proved  her  case  by  leading 
evidence, the appellant/defendant admittedly led no evidence.   <br/>
8.As also stated above, the title documents of the respondent/plaintiff, Ex.PW1/16 (colly) duly show right of the respondent/plaintiff  besides  to  the  basement  also  to  the  staircase  and  common 
passage etc.  The only way this evidence could be displaced  was by leading of 
evidence  by  the  appellant/defendant  with  respect  to  whether  he  was  the 
exclusive owner of the common passage on the ground floor, bathroom on the 
ground floor as also the back portion area for construction of the staircase, but 
since appellant/defendant led no evidence, appellant/defendant cannot be said to 
have proved his case of his ownership of the common passage, bathroom, back 
portion etc. <br/>
9.Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant/defendant  argued  that <br/>
appellant/defendant had moved an application before the first appellate court for 
leading additional evidence under Order  XLI Rule 27 CPC, but this application 
was illegally not decided by the first appellate court, however I note that right to 
lead  additional  evidence  under  Order  XLI  Rule  27  CPC  is  only  if  there  is 
already  some  evidence  of  a person  and additional evidence is  sought to be led 
on complying with the ingredients of Order XLI Rule 27 CPC.  However, once 
evidence of a person is closed because evidence is not led in spite of sufficient 
opportunities,  then  in  such  a  case,  the  provision  of  Order  XLI  Rule  27  CPC 
cannot be invoked.  <br/>
10.I  must  finally  note  that  even  before  this  Court  in  spite  of 
opportunities,  appellant/defendant  did  not  file  copies  of  his  title  documents  to 
show  that  he  was  the  exclusive  owner  of  the  ground  floor,  common  passage, 
bathroom on the ground floor or the back portion of the property. <br/>
11.In  view  of  the  above,  there  is  no  merit  in  this  Regular  Second 
Appeal  and  the  same  is  therefore  dismissed  as  no  sufficient  question  of  law 
arises. <b>            </b><br/>
